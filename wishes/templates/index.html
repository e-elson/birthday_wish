        <p>She's all shades of love and loyalty. It will also be off if I don't
        categorically state her love for God. Loving God is also seen in her comportment and the way she relates
        with people, of all class. Her selflessness is unfathomable. Ayomi, as she is fondly called literally brings joy to lives around her. She is a good fashion designer and works well with other fashion designers to bring quality and excellence to people's looks. She has a thriving career and has worked as a consultant for several international NGO's. She's currently
        pursuing a masters degree at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria.</p>
